# Decorator Pattern in C#
The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to add behaviors to classes separately using decorators. Each behavior is wrapped as a decorator and applied to the class. This approach lets us extend behaviors without modifying existing ones and keeps behaviors isolated. It also promotes code reuse, helping us avoid writing the same code multiple times.
